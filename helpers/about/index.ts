      "During my tenure at Interflora, I had the privilege of spearheading a transformative project that condensed two decades of technological advancements into a remarkable nine-month timeframe. With my expertise in Vue 3 with Nuxt, Typescript, Commercetools, Figma, Postcss, CSS Modules, GitHub, and code review, I collaborated closely with our co-partner to unite our efforts under an agile framework. Together, we successfully launched all three websites within the designated nine-month period, meeting our goals both punctually and within budget. This achievement established a next-generation digital infrastructure and fortified our internal capabilities, enabling future platform evolution. Significant improvements have been realized as a result of this endeavor, including: Cost Reduction: We achieved a notable 20% reduction in annual hosting costs by transitioning from an in-house hosted solution to a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering.Enhanced Functionality: Through our partnership with SaaS vendors, we consistently delivered ongoing new functionality to enrich the user experience. Agile Release Cycle: We significantly improved our release frequency by adopting fortnightly sprint releases, enabling faster deployment of updates and enhancements. Swift Deployment: Our optimised infrastructure empowered us to swiftly deploy key changes within hours if required, ensuring agility and responsiveness. Scalability: With our enhanced system, we successfully accommodated increased site load and seamlessly handled higher volumes of traffic. Streamlined Campaign Launches: The revamped platform provided us with the ability to easily launch and optimize campaigns, fostering efficient marketing initiatives. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and employing agile methodologies, we achieved remarkable outcomes that not only met our immediate objectives but also paved the way for future growth and success.",
